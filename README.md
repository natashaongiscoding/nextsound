  <h1>NextSound</h1>
  <br/>

  <p >
A music discovery app built with React and TypeScript. <br/> Browse tracks, albums, and artists using Spotify's API.
  </p>
</div>

<br/>
<br/>

## How it works

NextSound runs in two modes depending on your setup:

### Demo mode (no API needed)
Without API credentials:
- Curated collection of 2024-2025 chart toppers
- Works immediately after `git clone` and `npm install`
- Real album artwork and track metadata
- Features artists like Billie Eilish, Harry Styles, Morgan Wallen, and more

Benefits:
- Perfect for trying out the app quickly
- No API setup required
- Images load from Spotify CDN
- Shows off the full UI

<br/>


### With Spotify API (recommended)
If you have Spotify API credentials:
- Real-time access to Spotify's music catalog
- Search across millions of tracks, albums, and artists
- Latest trending songs and new releases
- All features available

Requires:
- Spotify API credentials in `.env` file
- Backend server running for CORS handling

<br/>


The app automatically detects which mode to use.

## Getting started

You need Node.js 18+ and npm.

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/natashaongiscoding/music-app.git
cd music-app
npm install

# Start the app
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` - the app works immediately with demo data.

<br>

### Want live Spotify data?

1. Create a [Spotify Developer Account](https://developer.spotify.com/) and create a new app
2. Get your Client ID and Client Secret from the app dashboard
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Add your credentials to `.env` (remove the # comments):
   ```env
   VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   ```
5. Start with the backend:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:full
   ```

## Testing

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

<br/>

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

<br/>

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **State:** Redux Toolkit with RTK Query
- **Routing:** React Router v6
- **Animations:** Framer Motion
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js (CORS proxy)
- **API:** Spotify Web API
- **Testing:** Vitest, Playwright

<br>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CORS Errors with Spotify API**
- **Problem:** API requests fail due to CORS restrictions
- **Solution:** Ensure the backend server is running (`npm run dev:full` or `npm run server:dev`)
- **Details:** Spotify Web API cannot be called directly from browsers due to CORS policy

**Missing Environment Variables**
- **Problem:** App shows "No music data available" or API errors
- **Solution:** Check that `.env` file exists with valid Spotify credentials
- **Reference:** See `SPOTIFY_SETUP.md` for obtaining API credentials

**Port Conflicts**
- **Frontend (Port 5173):** Check if another Vite/dev server is running
- **Backend (Port 3001):** Check if another Express server is using the port
- **Solution:** Kill existing processes or modify port configuration

**Build/TypeScript Errors**
- **Problem:** TypeScript compilation errors during build
- **Solution:** Run `npm run build` to see specific error details
- **Common fix:** Ensure all dependencies are installed (`npm install`)
